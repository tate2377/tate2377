- 👋 Hi, I’m @tate2377
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more code. I have an associates degree in electronic engineering but only touched on coding(too long a time ago). I've been studying a little on my own, but feel I need to just jump in here and see what happens.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all I can, when I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate my first solo self teaching endeavor. I'm wanting a simple code that would extract addresses from a list of job locations.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
